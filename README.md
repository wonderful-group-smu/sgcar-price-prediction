# sgcar-price-prediction

### Description
Our project primarily aims to predict used car prices for the dual purpose of helping sellers make better pricing decisions and informing buyers about their potential purchases. We have approached this problem as a regression problem by using traditional machine learning techniques to predict the fair price of a used car.

Refer to the notebook `main.ipynb` for the analysis.
